# Product Context: xdelo-app

## Problem Statement
Users need an efficient way to process, analyze, and manage media messages from Telegram that contain product information. Manual extraction of this data is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with multiple media files that belong to the same group.

## Solution Overview
xdelo-app automates the processing of Telegram media messages by:
1. Capturing incoming messages via a webhook
2. Downloading and storing media files
3. Analyzing captions to extract structured product data
4. Maintaining relationships between grouped media messages
5. Providing mechanisms for error recovery and audit

## User Personas

### Telegram Channel Administrators
- Need to process large volumes of media messages
- Require accurate extraction of product information from captions
- Want to maintain relationships between grouped media files

### Data Analysts
- Need access to structured product data extracted from captions
- Require reliable audit trails for data verification
- Want to query and analyze product information

### System Administrators
- Need tools for monitoring system health
- Require mechanisms for error recovery
- Want to ensure data integrity and consistency

## User Experience Goals
1. **Reliability**: Ensure all messages are processed correctly, even in case of temporary failures
2. **Accuracy**: Extract structured data from captions with high precision
3. **Consistency**: Maintain relationships between grouped media messages
4. **Transparency**: Provide comprehensive audit logging for all operations
5. **Recoverability**: Offer tools for error recovery and manual intervention

## Key Workflows

### Media Message Processing
1. Telegram sends a webhook update for a new media message
2. System downloads the media file and stores it in Supabase Storage
3. System analyzes the caption to extract structured product data
4. System stores the message and its analyzed content in the database
5. If the message is part of a media group, system synchronizes the analyzed content across all group members

### Caption Editing
1. User edits a caption in Telegram
2. System receives a webhook update for the edited message
3. System preserves the previous analyzed content in the history
4. System analyzes the new caption to extract updated product data
5. System synchronizes the updated content across all members of the media group

### Error Recovery
1. System detects a processing error (e.g., failed media download)
2. System logs the error and updates the message's processing state
3. System attempts automatic retries with exponential backoff
4. If automatic retries fail, system provides tools for manual intervention
5. Once the error is resolved, system resumes normal processing

## Success Metrics
1. **Processing Success Rate**: Percentage of messages successfully processed
2. **Data Extraction Accuracy**: Precision of structured data extraction from captions
3. **Synchronization Consistency**: Consistency of analyzed content across media group members
4. **Error Recovery Efficiency**: Time to recover from processing errors
5. **System Latency**: Time from message receipt to complete processing
