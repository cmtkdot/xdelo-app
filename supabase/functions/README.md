## Function Organization

## Recent Cleanup

We've recently made several improvements to the codebase:

1. **Removed Duplicated Functions**:
   - ✅ Deleted `validate-storage-files` - Functionality moved to telegram-webhook
   - ✅ Deleted `process-audio-upload` - Audio processing now in main media handler
   - ✅ Deleted `update-telegram-caption` - Caption editing in main handler

2. **Consolidated Media Utilities**:
   - ✅ Modularized `_shared/mediaUtils` into separate files
   - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility through exports

3. **Improved Logging**:
   - ✅ Moved `Logger` from `telegram-webhook/utils` to `_shared/logger`
   - ✅ Added better type safety and child logger support

4. **Removed JWT Verification**:
   - ✅ Deleted `_shared/jwt-verification.ts`
   - ✅ Created `_shared/securityLevel.ts` for backward compatibility
   - ✅ Made all functions publicly accessible without JWT

5. **Removed External Integrations**:
   - ✅ Deleted `xdelo_make-telegram-events` - Remove Make.com integration
   - ✅ Deleted `make-automation-manager` - Remove automation rules processing
   - ✅ Simplified telegram-webhook to not depend on external integrations
